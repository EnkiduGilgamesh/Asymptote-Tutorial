# 1 Start with "Hello world"

The simplest command in Asymptote is:

```c
settings.outformat="pdf"
label("Hello world!");
```

Compiled this .asy file, we can see a single page labeled with text "Hello world!" in the generated pdf file. The pdf output format is controlled by the beginning of the code, without which it well defaultly output dvi format.

We can control the font size by adding command:

```c
defaultpen(fontsize(10pt));
label("Hello world");
```

Let's look up the command `label` in Asymptote manual, and we can see the total command of it is below:

```c
void label(picture pic=currentpicture, 
            Label L, 
            pair position, 
            align align=NoAlign, 
            pen p= currentpen, 
            filltype filltypr=NoFill)
```

Let's talk about some of those parameters' meaning: 

* `picture` means that on which picture we will draw;

[//]: # (Which is also means, one diagram generated by Asymptote has several pictures, the more lately defined, the more upper.)

* `Label` is actually what we label on the picture.
* `pair` is the position that the label lies, formatted like (x,y);
* `pen` is how we draw the label, containing color, size, etc. options.
